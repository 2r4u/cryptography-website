            On August 31st, the day before the beginning of the world’s most impactful conflict, German signal intelligence intercepted a message from Poland to Britain. Its contents, deciphered using the Polish diplomatic code cracked years prior, revealed that Poland had no intention of pursuing serious negotiations with the Nazis. This message served as yet another excuse for Germany’s invasion plans, and the next day, troops surged across the border. Early on in the war, Germany had the clear edge in cryptography and cryptanalysis. The solution of the most British naval codes, which had been studied since the mid 1930s, gave the Nazis knowledge of almost all British Navy positions and strategies. By 1943, German cryptanalysts had, “mastered British naval cryptosystems so fully that they were even reading the British "U-Boat Situation Report"”, allowing them to avoid areas they were suspected to be at. The German dominance of cryptography in the early years of the war allowed its navy to dominate the seas. The Nazi’s deep knowledge of all British fleet information allowed them to easily deceive the Allies. For example, before the invasion of Norway, Germany drew the much larger British force away and swept through the country in a matter of days. In addition, German U-boats almost ended the war by cutting Britain off from the other Allies. During the height of the Battle of the Atlantic, from 1941-43, Nazi submarines sank over 300 Allied vessels. The shortage of supplies as a result of these losses nearly left England defenseless.        </p>
