            The Navajo code talkers, a group of Native American intelligence specialists, played a crucial role in World War Two, using their unique language to transmit messages that were virtually unbreakable by the Japanese.. The Navajo language was chosen because it was unwritten, complex, and had a unique syntax that made it incredibly difficult to decipher. The code talkers themselves were specially trained Marines who served in the Pacific Theater, including in some of the bloodiest battles of the war, such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa. They were sworn to secrecy, and only a select few knew of their existence and the importance of their work. The code talkers were able to transmit messages in mere seconds, far faster than any mechanical encryption machine of the time (Britannica: code talkers). The Navajo code talkers and their unique language were essential to American victory in the Pacific. These specially trained Native Americans were often instrumental in winning some of the largest battles of the war. On the battlefield, the code talkers transmitted messages that could only be understood by other Navajo, who were spread among larger units. The code they developed was so effective that it was never broken throughout the entire war.
