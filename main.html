        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Cryptography, the art of writing and solving codes, was one of the most important technologies utilized during World War Two. Around the globe, engineers, mathematicians, and communications experts helped create some of the most complicated and secure codes in human history, with some never being broken. These codes were often the only line of defense against enemy surveillance and were used to protect critical information. In addition, the renewed interest in complex patterns led to the development of one of humanityâ€™s most important inventions, the electronic computer. These new methods of security, and the tireless efforts to bypass them, were a huge deciding factor in the outcome of the war and the shape of the modern world.
