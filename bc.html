            Cryptanalysis is the art and science of deciphering encoded messages without the key. As the foil to cryptography, cryptanalysis began developing shortly after its counterpart. Those who specialize in cryptanalysis are known as code breakers. Unlike cryptography, with clearly defined principles, cryptography is often only possible because of individual talent, remarkable intuition, and recognition of almost invisible patterns (Britannica). All methods of cryptanalysis depend on the fact that some structure from the original message has survived the encryption. There are three distinct approaches to cryptanalysis, each requiring different prior knowledge. The cryptanalyst can have knowledge of just the encrypted text, both the encrypted and decrypted text, or chosen plain or cipher text. The first scenario, in which only the encrypted text is known, is by far the hardest to decode, requiring inside knowledge or extensive brute-forcing, the term for trying every possible option until you eventually find the right one. The second scenario, when the original message is known, is much more forgiving and can sometimes be the only thing needed to solve simple ciphers. The third scenario occurs when the cryptanalyst knows what the message they are decoding should probably say, such as a letter starting with “Dear Sir/Miss”. This may not be as powerful as knowing the whole message, but is extremely beneficial in situations where the cipher is changed regularly. As systems of cryptography become more advanced, the yardstick by which security is measured has shifted to quantify the length of time it would take to brute-force solve the code or cipher. Even with just the encrypted text available, a cryptanalyst will always be able to break the code through sheer volume of varied attempts. By this principle, “no cryptosystem can be more secure than its work function.”(Simmons) The principles and methods of breaking codes were extremely important in gaining an advantage during the war. Countries with stronger cryptanalysis techniques could gain access to almost all enemy information. In many cases, breaking a code could completely shift the balance of a battle or campaign. Nations with stronger cryptanalysts, such as the US and Great Britain, completely reversed the tide of the war because of their decrypting of Axis military codes, such as the German Enigma and Japanese PURPLE machines. In addition, many new advancements in the field of cryptanalysis were accelerated by the need to use them in war. As codes became more complex, technologies such as the Allied Bombes and the first computers grew to match them.
