            In the early morning of December 7, 1941, US Navy intelligence intercepted a message from Tokyo to Washington, D.C. The message, encoded using the Japanese PURPLE machine, was intended for the embassy in Washington. This message served as a breaking of diplomatic relations with the US, and was an early warning sign for the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, cryptography played a crucial role in the Pacific theater. Both the Allies and the Axis powers recognized the importance of secure communications and employed various cryptographic techniques to protect their messages. The Japanese were among the first to develop advanced encryption methods, including the Purple cipher, which they used to encode their diplomatic communications. However, the Americans were able to crack the Purple cipher using a machine called the Magic machine, which enabled them to read Japanese diplomatic messages and gain valuable intelligence. The Japanese also used another cipher called the JN-25, which they used to encrypt their naval communications. However, American cryptographers were able to decipher this cipher as well, allowing them to track Japanese naval movements and gain an advantage in the Pacific. The Americans also developed their own cipher systems, such as the SIGABA machine, which they used to encrypt their military communications. Cryptography was also used by the Australians in the Pacific theater. Australian codebreakers were able to decipher Japanese messages using a machine called the TypeX, which allowed them to intercept and read Japanese naval communications. The Australians were also able to use their intelligence to help the Allies in the Pacific, including providing information that led to the sinking of a Japanese submarine (Kahn). The war in the Pacific would have looked very different without the work of the United States’ cryptographers. The attack on Pearl Harbor, which cryptanalysts had warned about, left the US Pacific Fleet crippled. As the Japanese prepared to advance further and take Midway island, these same cryptanalysts, piecing together bits of information from intercepted Japanese messages, gave the US the information it needed to avoid the trap and destroy four Japanese aircraft carriers. As the Allies advanced, hopping between small islands, they used their knowledge of Japanese codes to estimate the strength of each island’s defenses. This info significantly reduced losses and allowed for a faster pace.
