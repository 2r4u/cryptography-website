            In August 1941, an attaché working at the US embassy in Rome stole the codebook for BLACK, a code primarily used by diplomats and the military. This was quickly shared with Germany, and allowed it to read many of the messages of a potential enemy. Later that year, Colonel Frank Fellers, an American military attaché in Cairo, began closely observing military action in North Africa. He studied British tactics and the problems of desert warfare, carefully encoded his voluminous and detailed reports in the BLACK code and sending them to Washington. Axis radio stations intercepted and transmitted them to General Erwin Rommel, providing him with the clearest picture of enemy forces and intentions available to any Axis commander throughout the war. These reports were instrumental in Rommel's success in driving the British back 300 miles in seventeen days during the North African campaign. However, by July 1942, Rommel had lost this advantage. The Allies had discovered the interceptions and recalled Fellers to Washington. Rommel’s advance was halted, and he went on the defensive. In October, British general Montgomery took the Afrika Corps by surprise and routed them in the battle of El Alamein. This was a major turning point in the war, and Germany never stopped retreating from then on. In the war in North Africa, cryptography played a huge role in swinging the tide of the brutal desert combat. Rommel’s free access to British military intelligence, along with his superior strategies, nearly won the campaign on their own. However, after the American leak in Cairo was fixed, the Allies, who already had access to most of Germany’s military codes, quickly gained the advantage and drove the Axis out of Africa. This was a major turning point in the war, and gave the Allies a stepping stone from which to advance into Italy, and then Germany.
