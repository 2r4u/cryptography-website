            During the Interwar period after World War One, new technological advances in the fields of mechanics and communications prompted the creation of the first rotor-based ciphers, the gold standard for speed and security. These machines work by manipulating the electrical current in a group of mechanical wheels, called rotors. The positions of these rotors then determine the encryption of the message. The most advanced devices of this type could also print a typed message in the new cipher (Simmons). The most famous among these complex machines was the German Enigma cipher. The Enigma machine was developed by Arthur Scherbius in 1918. In the late 1920s, after their defeat in World War One, the rebuilding German military needed a new secure code for communications. The Enigma was much more secure than most rotor cipher because of its use of a plug board, which allowed for an additional substitution cipher on top of the random code. To decipher a message, one needed a machine with the exact settings and rotor positions, which was impossible to obtain outside the German military. The Enigma became the primary method for encrypting and decrypting messages, and, along with the development of radio, allowed Germany to send and receive hundreds of secret messages per day (Solving the Enigma). The easy manipulation, large number of combinations, and extensive security made the Enigma one of the most powerful cipher machines of the war. Before it was broken, the Enigma cipher was key to Germanyâ€™s dominance of Europe. The blitzkrieg invasions of most of Europe were facilitated by the secure communications using codes generated on a daily basis. In addition, the limited production and distribution of the cipher machines greatly enhanced their security.
