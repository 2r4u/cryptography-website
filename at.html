            Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist who made significant contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, and cryptography. He was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England, and attended King’s College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics. During World War II, Turing worked for the British government as a cryptanalyst, helping to crack the Enigma code used by the Germans to encrypt their military communications. Turing’s work on the code was essential to turning the tide towards Allied victory. After the war, Turing continued to work on computing and artificial intelligence, developing the concept of a universal computing machine, which laid the foundation for modern computers. He also proposed the Turing Test, used to determine whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Turing’s life was tragically cut short despite his contributions to science. He was prosecuted for homosexuality in 1952, and underwent harsh chemical treatment. He was found dead from cyanide in his bed later that year, with his death ruled a suicide. Turing’s legacy has since been recognized and celebrated. In 2009, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology on behalf of the British government for the way Turing was treated, calling his treatment “appalling”. Today, Turing is widely regarded as a pioneer in computer science and one of the most important figures of the 20th century (Copeland). Alan Turing was one of the most impactful figures in the history of cryptography. His work on the cryptanalysis of the Enigma saved millions of lives and greatly shortened the war. His work after the war in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence laid the groundwork for many things we take for granted today. Turing’s concept of a universal computing machine was the basis for the goals of early computers. In addition, the Turing test is still used to measure the strength of artificial intelligence, even after seventy-five years.
