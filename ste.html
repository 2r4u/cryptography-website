            As early as 1928, Polish cryptanalysts began attempting to break the Enigma code. They recognized the change to a machine cipher and purchased a commercial version, but it was not similar enough to provide any real information. Despite these challenges, the Polish cipher bureau hired three mathematicians, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki, and Henryk Zygalsk to slowly analyze the intercepted messages for clues. Even after developing an equation to find the wiring of the rotors, the Poles lacked the information to solve it. Miraculously, French intelligence officers received information from a source in Berlin detailing the workings of the machine and some keys. This provided enough for Rejewski and others to create an equation to break the code. Poland used this equation to develop a machine called a bombe that was able to brute-force decrypt the Enigma’s messages.  In 1939, Poland knew Germany would soon invade the country. Thinking that it would no longer be safe to continue making progress with the Enigma cipher, the Polish cryptographers and government decided to turn over all the knowledge that they had acquired about the Enigma, along with the replicas they had built, to the French and British governments. The British government immediately hired the top minds in the fields of mathematics, science, and engineering to work on deciphering Germany messages at a facility at Bletchley Park. Two of these mathematicians, Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman, collaborated to produce a new design that optimized the process. Turing greatly reduced the work needed by looking for words that were consistently sent in German messages. This, along with Welchman’s analysis of the plug board system and the prowess of British engineers at BTM, resulted in the creation of the first of 210 Bombes used throughout the war. As soon as the first machines were completed in August 1940, the Allies had a window into almost all Nazi communications. German certainty in the unbreakable nature of the Enigma made it significantly easier for messages to be decrypted. Despite German efforts to increase security by adding more rotors, the Allies, now with the help of the US, were able to continue updating the bombes almost as quickly (Solving the Enigma). The solution of the Enigma cipher can be considered as one of the most important events of the war in Europe. The ability to read nearly all Nazi messages gave access to intelligence on an unprecedented scale. Within a year, British ships in the North Atlantic, which had been hounded by Nazi submarines for most of the war, saw substantial decreases in the number of ships lost. After the United States entered the war in early 1942, the research pioneered at Bletchley Park was used to create standardized decryption machines for use throughout the military. When the liberation of Western Europe began with D-Day, the intelligence advantage provided let the Allies quickly gain a foothold and liberate France. After the code breaking was declassified, many Allied governments agreed that it took years off the war.
