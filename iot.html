            After the conflict came to a close, the scientific and technological breakthroughs used in cryptography helped inspire and improve new technologies. With the advent of modern computing, cryptography has become more complex and powerful, enabling new levels of security and privacy. The impact of cryptography on technology after World War II can be seen in various fields, including telecommunications, finance, and e-commerce. One of the most notable examples of the impact of cryptography on technology is the development of public-key cryptography, which allows secure communication between parties without prior communication. Another area where cryptography has had a profound impact is in the field of telecommunications. The use of cryptography in mobile phone networks has made it possible to secure communications between mobile devices, protecting against eavesdropping and other security threats. The advancements made in cryptography during World War Two were essential to the development of many things we take for granted. If you’ve ever ordered anything on Amazon, sent an email, or logged into a website, you’ve used cryptography, albeit unknowingly. E-commerce sites such as Amazon are completely dependent on public key cryptography, using it to securely transmit and verify payment information. Any website that stores your data will have it encrypted in their database, and any email you send will be unreadable to those unauthorized. Another more recent development is the popularization of cryptocurrency, a form of payment that represents a completely unique equation that is nearly impossible to solve, giving it value. Much of the internet and the global electronic revolution would not be possible without cryptographic advancements made during WWII.
